The School is a foundation for development. It stays with the child as a child forever .It defines child‘s future. It creates a mould just as a potter creates his masterpiece. It brings colour and form to do the child’s being just as a painter makes a canvas live.It evolves the child to a valuable human being as an asset to the society. It is therefore one of the most important decision you make for your child.

At Shantiniketan World School, learning and education is fun. Our School is a “home” in a completely different paradigm.

In this melting pot, children learn to develop holistic skills which mould them into the class of Ideal Global responsible citizens, prepare them to contribute proactively to this universe where children as individual human beings are encouraged to go out and think independently , diversify their thoughts and translate them into positive actions and goals.
