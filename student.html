<u><b>How is it like to study at Shantiniketan World School</b></u>?
<ul type="square">
<li><p>Before in the late 19th century or in the early 20th century SNWS was a very prestigious school (just on a whole different level).</li></p>

<li><p>So, we just still have a stereotype that students in SNWS are really good and stand out in academics but actually it's not as just 30â€“45% SNWS students (I don't know exactly so y'all can correct me if I am wrong) are smart or good in studies.</li></p>

<li><p>Well, I have witnessed it through my own eyes as most of my classmates are below average and as for me it's just slightly above average (like somehow manages to get over 90% in exams).</li></p>

<li><p>So yeah, it's just a stereotype that SNWS stands out in academics when it used to take place years back.</li></p>
</ul>
