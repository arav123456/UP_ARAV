<b><u>About SNWS</u>:-</b>

<b><u>The School’s goals are based on the following beliefs</u>-</b>

<p><li>When children play, make – belief, they use their imagination and develop creativity.</li></p>
<p><li>Teachers help children’s language development by reading to them, singing simple songs with movement encouraging their participation.</li></p>
<p><li>Our learning goals for children include – participating as part of a classroom community, developing social competence, developing early language and mathematics concepts.</li></p>

<i><b>“Do not set limitations for your child. Let him aim for stars”.</b></i>
<p>To make this happen we are coming up with X-SEED, a research- based academic program that builds thinking skills and problem solving confidence in children. Here the children ask more questions, can write on their own like doing word problems in mathematics, can  complete their homework on their own, are not afraid to speak in English, persist longer in solving problems and score well on tests. We build connections between the child’s day at school and life at home.</p>
